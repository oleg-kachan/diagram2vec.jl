# diagram2vec.jl

Diagram2vec.jl provides the following finite-dimensional vector representations of the persistence diagrams:

- persistence statistics (statistics of quanitites such as persistence, midlife, mult.life)
- Euler characteristic curve
- k-th Betti number curves
- persistence curves (curves of quanitites such as persistence, midlife, multitplicative life)
- entropy curves (curves of entropy of quanitites such as persistence, midlife, multitplicative life)

All representations have &epsilon;-robust versions, i.e. not taking into account intervals with persistence below a certain threshold.
